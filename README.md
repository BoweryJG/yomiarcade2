# Yomi® Accuracy Challenge

An interactive web-based dental implant placement simulator that demonstrates the accuracy differences between freehand, static guided, and Yomi robotic-assisted placement methods.

## Overview

The Yomi® Accuracy Challenge is an educational game that allows users to virtually place dental implants using three different methods, comparing their performance against clinical data from Dr. Jay Neugarten's study showing Yomi's 80% error reduction.

## Features

- **Three Placement Methods**: Freehand, Static Guided, and Yomi Robotic-Assisted
- **Real-time 3D Simulation**: Interactive implant placement with angle and depth feedback
- **Clinical Data Integration**: Compare your results against actual study data
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full touch support and optimized for all devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Tutorial System**: Interactive onboarding for first-time users
- **Analytics**: Track user performance and engagement metrics

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with ES6 modules
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js for WebGL rendering
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: CSS with custom properties and mobile-first approach
- **Animations**: GSAP for smooth transitions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BoweryJG/yomiarcade2.git
cd yomiarcade2
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
