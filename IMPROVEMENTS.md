# Yomi Arcade 2 - Improvements Summary

## ✅ Completed Enhancements

### 1. **Modern Build System with Vite**
- Migrated from vanilla HTML/JS to Vite-powered ES6 modules
- Added hot module replacement for faster development
- Configured production build optimization
- Set up proper asset handling and code splitting

### 2. **ES6 Module Architecture**
- Refactored monolithic code into modular components:
  - `app.js` - Main application controller
  - `simulation.js` - 3D simulation management
  - `uiManager.js` - UI state and transitions
  - `audioManager.js` - Sound effects and haptics
  - `tutorialManager.js` - Interactive onboarding
  - `analyticsManager.js` - User tracking
- Implemented proper separation of concerns
- Added dependency injection pattern

### 3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Created `ErrorHandler` class with error boundaries
- Added WebGL detection and fallback
- Implemented graceful degradation for missing features
- User-friendly error messages with recovery options
- Proper error logging and analytics integration

### 4. **Loading States & Asset Management**
- Built `LoadingManager` for coordinated asset loading
- Added progress indicators with percentage display
- Implemented loading screens with smooth transitions
- Preload critical assets for better performance

### 5. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Complete mobile-first responsive design
- Touch gesture support (tap, drag, pinch-to-zoom)
- Adaptive layouts for portrait/landscape
- Touch-optimized controls (44px minimum targets)
- Mobile-specific UI adjustments

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **3D Dental Models**
   - Replace placeholder geometry with realistic models
   - Load GLTF models for jaw, teeth, implants
   - Add texture and material support
   - Implement proper lighting

2. **Results Visualization**
   - Create 3D comparison view
   - Show implant placement accuracy
   - Visual feedback on errors
   - Export results functionality

### Medium Priority
